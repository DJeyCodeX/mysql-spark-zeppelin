2. Save the changes and open notebook which was created in previous step.

3. Execute below commands in the cells:

%spark
val a = sc.textFile("/user/ec2-user/Suicides.csv")
val header = a.first
val data = a.filter(_ != header)
case class suicides(state:String,year:Int,causes:String,type1:String,gender:String,agegroup:String,total:Int)
val suicides_df = data.map(_.split(",")).map(x => suicides(x(0),x(1).toInt,x(2),x(3),x(4),x(5),x(6).toInt)).toDF()
suicides_df.createOrReplaceTempView("suicides")
